# signup-form
Sign-up form project to practice more intermediate/advanced HTML and CSS skills.
The goal of this project was to play around with forms, form validation, form
styling, CSS selectors and pseudoclasses, and images. The form information is
just dummy text but could easily be changed to real information of a real website
or company. The form is only designed to be displayed properly on the browser 
but I will be adding support for a mobile format in the future.
